##### What is Profhilo?

Profhilo is a unique injectable skin treatment, designed to improve overall skin quality and and boost the ageing skin. Few injectable treatments target the skin, but this award-winning treatment has changed the game!

Profhilo contains one of the highest levels of hyaluronic acid on the market. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the body, found in deep layers of the skin and is responsible for keeping the skin moisturised. As well as elastin and collagen, hyaluronic acid production reduces with age, giving the appearance of lax and tired-looking skin.

##### How does it work?

For Profhilo to be successful, you will need a course of two treatments, four weeks apart. Once injected, not only does it add moisture directly into the skin, but it also stimulates your natural collagen and elastin production.

This treatment is suitable for those who want to combat the signs of ageing and boost their general skin health. The procedure has no downtime, and within weeks your skin will appear more hydrated, tighter and smoother.

You will see full effects 8-10 weeks, and results can last 6-9 months.

##### What is the difference between Profhilo and hyaluronic acid-based fillers?

Although both are made from hyaluronic acid, Profhilo has a higher concentration of hyaluronic acid and is manufactured differently. The unique formula allows us to inject the hyaluronic acid directly into the skin in a wide range of areas - whereas this wouldnâ€™t be possible with traditional hyaluronic acid fillers. Because it is injected superficially, it allows us to treat multiple areas safely that is not usually recommended with soft tissue fillers.
